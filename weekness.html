                                    will influence each other. For Marvel, Since DC was acquired by Warner
                                    as early as 69 years ago, DC is very strong in distribution channels and so
                                    on. At that time, the U.S. cartoon market shrank, and Marvel's original
                                    distribution channel was particularly limited.

                                    Copyright issue are complicate and hard to solve it, the best way to solve
                                    this is teamwork with other companies, this teamwork is not about
                                    internal of the company, it is a external teamwork Strategy with other
                                    companies. It is considered as cooperation. Marvel should cooperate with
                                    other companies and publish some joint works to reduce the impact of
                                    copyright decentralization.
